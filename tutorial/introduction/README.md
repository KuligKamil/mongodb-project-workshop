## MongoDB

# TODO, draft version from MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. Here are its key characteristics:

Document-Oriented: Stores data in JSON-like documents (BSON format), allowing flexible and complex data structures.

Schema-Less: No predefined schema is required, making it easy to handle varying data structures.

Horizontal Scalability: Supports sharding for distributing data across servers, enabling easy scaling.

Rich Query Language: Offers powerful queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregations.

High Performance: Optimized with in-memory processing and efficient storage.

ACID Transactions: Supports multi-document transactions, ensuring data consistency.

Replication: Uses replica sets for high availability and data redundancy.

Geospatial Support: Includes geospatial indexing for querying location-based data.

Open-Source: Backed by a large community and extensive ecosystem.

MongoDB is ideal for handling large, diverse, and dynamic datasets in modern applications.
